# WebRTC Client Demo

This project is a frontend implementation of a WebRTC client with features for real-time audio-video streaming and chat messaging. It allows users to create and join rooms, enabling seamless peer-to-peer communication.

## Features

- **Room Management**: Create and join video chat rooms.
- **Real-Time Audio/Video Streaming**: High-quality peer-to-peer video and audio connection.
- **Real-Time Chat Messaging**: Text messaging over a Socket.IO connection.

## Tech Stack

- **React** with **TypeScript** for building the UI.
- **WebRTC** for real-time audio and video streaming.
- **Socket.IO** for managing signaling and chat messaging.
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** for styling and UI components.

## Prerequisites

1. **Signaling Server**: Before running this client, ensure the signaling server is set up. Follow instructions at: [WebRTC Server Repo](https://github.com/msusman1/webrtc-server).
2. **Configure Signaling Server URL**:
   - Set the server URL in `SocketConnection.ts` by updating `SERVER_URL` to point to your running signaling server.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msusman1/webrtc-client.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash

   ```

## Known Issues

- **Remote Streams Not Displaying**: The UI currently does not display streams from other users, even though they are successfully received in the `RTCPeerConnection.ontrack` event. This issue is under investigation.
